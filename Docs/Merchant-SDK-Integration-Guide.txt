📘 Purpose

Enable merchants (e.g., Emirates Red, Dufry, Heinemann) to easily integrate AeroShop Agentic AI modules into their existing web or mobile storefronts with minimal dev effort.


🔧 Overview

AeroShop Agentic Suite SDK provides modular components:
Agentic Search → natural-language product search.
Agentic Chat → event-driven assistant that reacts to user actions.
Agentic Recommender → contextual product carousels.
All modules are independent — merchants can activate only the ones they need.


🧩 Installation
Web Integration (JS/React/Vue)
<script src="https://cdn.aeroshop.ai/sdk/v2/aeroshop.js"></script>
<script>
AeroShop.init({
  merchant_id: "EMIRATESRED",
  api_key: "YOUR_MERCHANT_KEY",
  theme: "dark",
  locale: "en-GB",
  modules: ["search", "chat", "recommendations"]
});
</script>

Mobile Integration (React Native / Flutter)
Add dependency:
npm install aeroshop-sdk
Initialize in App.js:
import { AeroShop } from 'aeroshop-sdk';
AeroShop.init({
  merchantId: 'EMIRATESRED',
  apiKey: 'YOUR_KEY',
  theme: 'light',
  modules: ['chat', 'search'],
});


📡 Event Hooks

Merchants trigger standardized events from their frontend to make the chat context-aware.

Event	When Triggered	Example Payload
aeroshop:add_to_cart	On Add-to-Cart click	{ product_id, name, price, currency, image_url }
aeroshop:remove_from_cart	On cart removal	{ product_id, name }
aeroshop:checkout_start	When user begins checkout	{ cart_value, item_count }
aeroshop:purchase_complete	On order confirmation	{ order_id, value, currency }

Example:

window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("aeroshop:add_to_cart", {
  detail: {
    product_id: "DF-00123",
    name: "Chanel No.5 Perfume 50ml",
    price: 139.0,
    currency: "USD",
    image_url: "https://cdn.airline.com/p/df00123.jpg"
  }
}));


The chat automatically reacts:

“✅ Chanel No.5 added to your cart. Ready to checkout?”
[View Cart] [Checkout Now]

🛒 Deep Link Configuration

Define cart & checkout URLs in merchant console:

{
  "deep_links": {
    "cart": "https://merchant.com/app/cart",
    "checkout": "https://merchant.com/app/cart/checkout"
  }
}


🧠 Personalization Context (Optional)

Provide non-sensitive context for personalization.

AeroShop.setContext({
  trip: { from: "DXB", to: "CDG" },
  cabin: "Business",
  loyalty_tier: "Gold"
});
