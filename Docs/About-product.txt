🏗️ PRODUCT: AeroShop Agentic Component Suite (B2B Offering)
🎯 Core Idea

Give every airline or travel merchant a ready-to-plug AI Shopping Companion that works across their web or mobile storefront 
— improving product discovery, engagement, and conversion 
— without replacing their existing user experience.


🔹 1. Offer It as a “USC” (Universal Smart Component)

Think of it like Stripe Elements or Zendesk widgets, but for Agentic Commerce.

Each component is a modular UI + backend intelligence block that merchants can embed with a few lines of code.

Component	What it Does	Typical Placement
🧠 Agentic Search Bar	Natural-language product search	Home or catalog page
💬 Agentic Chat Widget	Reacts to user actions (add-to-cart, checkout)	Floating bottom-right chat bubble
🪄 Smart Recommender Strip	Context-aware product carousel	Product detail page
🛍️ Cart Companion	Notifies on cart events & recommends upsells	Checkout screen
📊 Merchant Insights Console	Analytics & performance metrics	Merchant dashboard

“✅ Chanel No.5 added to cart. Want to checkout or see bundle offers?”
User taps “Checkout Now” → deep link to merchant checkout.
AI logs event → merchant dashboard shows “AI-assisted conversions +14%”.
